# Preface

I have worked with developing embedded systems for over twenty years, mainly in aerospace and automotive industries. I have had different roles; tester, modeller, coder, and architect (and the only one I thought I was above average was as architect). One of the most instructive task I have done was to review code that did not work from suppliers and subcontractors, and try to pinpoint the problems and suggest improvements. It is then I realised that crafting good embedded software is a professional domain in its own, and is not easy to penetrate even for professional programmers.

The emrbyo for this book came when I left industry and taught embedded programming at college level for four years. My students always asked me if there isn't a book that covers what I teach in my courses (I assume as an alternative taking extensive notes in class) and I always had to answer that I haven't found any. So each chapter in this book originites from a lesson I gave. 

Most books on development of embedded software usually starts with a certain processor family and give examples on how to develop device software, middleware and applications on that family.
This book attempts to take the opposite route. It gives an overview of pragmatic software designs and code examples that are agnostic of a specific processor. I try to focus on fundamental principles together with topics that are perceived as thresholds to entering the subject of embedded programming.
The book is not complete in the sense that it contains everything you need to know, in its present format it just delves into a few key topics.

In one respect the book is not agnostic, it uses C as the language for code examples. Even though C is an old language it is still the most widely used language for embedded systems, especially real-time systems. However, I have also included diagrams showing principles where applicable, and these could be implemented in any language.

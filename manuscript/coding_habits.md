## Good coding habits

### Writing for the programmer and not the compiler


### Naming conventions
There are conventions that almost all programmers adhere to such as `i, j, k, l, m, n` is used as variables in a for-loop (I assume this originates from the implicit type declaration of integer variables in e.g. Fortran IV.)

Should type be reflected in the name?

### Implicit or explicit assumptions of how C does things
How enumeration is encoded

Treating booleans
